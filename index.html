			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>I'm Jacob McDonnell. I have been interested in computers since I was young. 
				My father has been in the technology field since before I was born, so I guess that interest came from him. 
				<br><br> My interests, with respect to computers, are programming, UNIX/Plan9, and electronics/hardware. 
				I know how to program in Java thanks to a high school course, and I like the language for somethings. 
				Currently, I am learning the Go programming language with the hope to replace Java for a nice compiled single binary file. I would like to write my own unix-like operating system one day. 
				In my free time I like to play basketball, row, practice German and Russian, and play guitar. <br><br> 
				I do not know what I will do with this website just yet, maybe I will write articles about projects that I am
				 working on.</p>
				 <h2>Projects</h2>
				 <p><a href="https://github.com/JacobMcDonnell/jed">Jed</a> is my own version of ed, currently written in java.</p>
				 <p><a href="https://github.com/JacobMcDonnell/ticalcprograms">Ticalcprograms</a> are a set of 
					 small programs written in C for the TI-84 Plus CE graphing calculator.</p>
