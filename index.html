			<h2><a name="about">About</a></h2>
			<p>I'm Jacob McDonnell. I have been interested in computers since I was young. 
				My father has been in the technology field since before I was born, so I guess that interest came from him. 
				<br><br> My interests, with respect to computers, are programming, UNIX/Plan9, and electronics/hardware. 
				I know how to program in Java thanks to a high school course, and I like the language for somethings. 
				Currently I am learning the C programming language with the hopes to write my own operating system one day. 
				In my free time I like to play basketball, row, practice German and Russian, and play guitar. <br><br> 
				I do not know what I will do with this website just yet, maybe I will write articles about projects that I am working on.</p>
