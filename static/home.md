## About
I'm Jacob McDonnell. I have been interested in computers since I was young.
My father has been in the technology field since before I was born, so I guess
that interest came from him. Currently, I am a 4th semester student at Penn
State studying computer science.

My interests, with respect to computers, are programming, UNIX/Plan9, and
electronics/hardware. Thanks to AP Computer Science A, I have a good
understanding of Java. In college, I picked up Python and, most recently, C.
I would like to write my own unix-like operating system one day.

I do not know what I will do with this website just yet, maybe I will write
articles about projects that I am working on.

## Projects
[This Website](https://github.com/JacobMcDonnell/JacobMcDonnell.com) is written
in Python using Flask.

[jlib](https://github.com/JacobMcDonnell/jlib) is a c library of type
independent implementations of data structures.
