## About
I'm Jacob McDonnell. I have been interested in computers since I was young.
My father has been in the technology field since before I was born, so I guess
that interest came from him.

My interests, with respect to computers, are programming, UNIX/Plan9, and
electronics/hardware. I know how to program in Java thanks to a high school
course, and I like the language for somethings. Currently, I am learning the
Go programming language with the hope to replace Java for a nice compiled
single binary file. I would like to write my own unix-like operating system one
day. In my free time I like to play basketball, row, practice German and
Russian, and play guitar.

I do not know what I will do with this website just yet, maybe I will write
articles about projects that I am working on.

## Projects
[This Website](https://github.com/JacobMcDonnell/JacobMcDonnell.com) is written
in Python using Flask.

[Jed](https://github.com/JacobMcDonnell/jed) is my own version of ed, currently
written in java.
